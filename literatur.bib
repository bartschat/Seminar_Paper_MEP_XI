abstract = {The case is set at the end of 2006 when Nintendo and Sony were preparing to launch their seventh generation gaming consoles while Microsoft had its console on the market for more than a year. Starting with the fifth generation (when the PlayStation was first introduced), the competition among the three main players in the market was focused mostly at the segment of " hard-core " gamers – young adults spending substantial time playing elaborate games. By 2006 Nintendo was hopelessly losing the competition in this segment. The company had to come up with a bold move to remain relevant in the industry. So, rather than staying within the confines of the familiar segment, Nintendo decided to target its new console to a market that was all but neglected in the previous decade – the casual gamers: kids, women, older folks, and families. The case is used as a basis for the discussion of targeting decision process.},

@article{Danaher2010,
abstract = {The availability of digital channels for media distribution has raised many important questions for marketers, notably, whether digital distribution channels will cannibalize physical sales and whether legitimate digital distribution channels will dissuade consumers from using (illegitimate) digital piracy channels. We address these two questions using the removal of NBC content from Apple's iTunes store in December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks to the supply of legitimate digital content, and we analyze the impact of this shock on demand through BitTorrent piracy channels and the Amazon.com DVD store. To do this we collected two large data sets from Mininova.com and Amazon.com, documenting levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and other major networks' content around these events. We analyze these data in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC's decision to remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated with an 11.4{\%} increase in the demand for NBC's pirated content. This is roughly equivalent to an increase of 48,000 downloads a day for NBC's content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant, decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the iTunes store in September 2008. Finally, we see no change in demand for NBC's DVD content at Amazon.com associated with NBC's closing or reopening of its digital distribution channel on iTunes.},

The results are based on empirical studies of a variety of popular achievement systems. The results, along with the framework for analyzing and designing achievements, present two definitions of game achievements. From the perspective of the achievement system, an achievement appears as a challenge consisting of a signifying element, rewards and completion logics whose fulfilment conditions are defined through events in other systems (usually games). From the perspective of a single game, an achievement appears as an optional challenge provided by a meta-game that is independent of a single game session and yields possible reward(s)},

abstract = {Networked multiplayer games must support a much wider variety of interactions than single-player games because networked games involve communication and coordination between players. This means that designers must consider additional usability issues that relate to group play – but there are currently no usability engineering methods that are specifically oriented towards the needs of multiplayer games. To address this problem, we developed a new set of usability heuristics, called Networked Game Heuristics (NGH), which can be used in the design and evaluation of networked multiplayer games. The new heuristics were identified by analyzing problem reports from 382 reviews of networked PC games, covering six main genres. We aggregated problem reports into ten problem categories (covering issues from session management to cheating to training for novice players) and developed heuristics that describe how these usability problems can be avoided. We tested the new heuristics by having evaluators use them and an existing set to assess the usability of two networked games. Evaluators found more usability problems with NGH, and stated that the new heuristics were better for evaluating multiplayer game usability. Our research is the first to present networked game heuristics that are derived from real problem reports, and the first to evaluate the heuristics' effectiveness in a realistic usability test.},

abstract = {Can indirect network effects lead to adoption externalities? If so, when? We show that in markets where consumption benefits arise from hardware/software systems, adoption externalities will occur when there are (i) increasing returns to scale in the production of software, (ii) free entry in software, and (iii) consumers have a preference for software variety. The private benefit of the marginal hardware purchaser is less than the social benefit since the marginal hardware purchaser does not internalize the welfare improving response of the software industry, particularly the increase in software variety, on inframarginal purchasers when the market for hardware expands.

@article{Rochet2004,
abstract = {The paper offers an introduction and a road map to the burgeoning literature on two-sided markets. In many industries, platforms court two (or more) sides that use the platform to interact with each other. The platforms' usage or variable charges impact the two sides' willingness to trade, and thereby their net surpluses from potential interactions; the platforms' membership or fixed charges in turn determine the end-users' presence on the platform. The platforms' fine design of the structure of variable and fixed charges is relevant only if the two sides do not negotiate away the corresponding usage and membership externalities. The paper first focuses on usage charges and provides conditions for the alloca- tion of the total usage charge (e.g., the price of a call or of a payment card trans- action) between the two sides not to be neutral; the failure of the Coase theorem is necessary but not sufficient for two-sidedness. Second, the paper builds a canonical model integrating usage and membership externalities. This model allows us to unify and compare the results obtained in the two hitherto disparate strands of the literature emphasizing either form of ex- ternality; and to place existing membership (or indirect) externalities models on a stronger footing by identifying environments in which these models can accommo- date usage pricing. We also obtain general results on usage pricing of independent interest. Finally, the paper reviews some key economic insights on platform price and non-price strategies.},

abstract = {Online interactivity is becoming a valuable way of improving the communication quality of business web sites. As a result, it is important that web site designers understand the concept and how it affects the quality of web site design. This study empirically validated Ha and James' five interactivity dimensions (playfulness, connectedness, reciprocal communication, information collection, and choice) and their relationship to design quality. The findings suggested that the playfulness, connectedness, and reciprocal communication dimensions are important predictors of web site quality. While information collection tools are powerful for web engineering and user tracking, the companies surveyed here had not fully used the promising potential of such tools. The choice dimension, although it offered flexibility and customizability to users, was not significant in predicting web site quality. The results underscored the viability of interactivity dimensions in the online environment. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Givon1995,
abstract = {Software piracy by users has been identified as the worst problem facing the software industry today. Software piracy permits the shadow diffusion of a software parallel to its legal diffusion in the marketplace, increasing its user base over time. Because of this software shadow diffusion, a software firm loses potential profits, access to a significant proportion of the software user base, opportunities for cross-selling, and marketing its other products and new generations of the software. However, shadow diffusion may influence the legal diffusion of the software. Software pirates may influence potential software users to adopt the software, and some of these adopters may become buyers. A diffusion modeling approach is suggested to track shadow diffusion and the legal diffusion of a software over time. The approach enables management to estimate (1) the pirated adoptions over time and (2) the percentage of legal adoptions due to the influence of pirates. The modeling approach is applied to study the diffusion of two types of software (spreadsheets and word processors) in the United Kingdom. The results suggest that although six of every seven software users utilized pirated copies, these pirates were responsible for generating more than 80{\%} of new software buyers, thereby significantly influencing the legal diffusion of the software. The implications of these results are discussed.},

@article{Jakobsson2011,
abstract = {Xbox Live achievements and gamerscores have become an integral part of Xbox 360 gaming. Based on the framework provided by Microsoft, the community has developed intriguing gaming practices where the individual games become pieces of a larger whole. This paper, based on a two year community study, explores how players have reacted and adapted to the system. To get at this shift in console gaming, the achievement system is seen as a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) where separate achievements are the functional equivalent of quests. By conceptualizing the achievement system as an MMO, the paper questions the dichotomy between PC/MMO and console gaming. The paper also goes into detailed descriptions of gaming habits and strategies that have emerged as gamers appropriate the achievement system, in particular looking at three player types: achievement casuals, hunters and completists. My conclusions are that the Xbox Live achievement system only partially functions as a reward system. More importantly, in terms of impact on player practices, it is an invisible MMO that all Xbox Live members participate in, whether they like it or not. On one hand, the different strategies and ways of conceptualizing the system shows how players have appropriated the technology and rules provided by Microsoft, and socially constructed systems that fit their play styles. On the other hand, many players are deeply conflicted over these gaming habits and feel trapped in a deterministic system that dictates ways of playing the games that they do not enjoy. Both sides can ultimately be connected to distinguishable characteristics of gamers. As a group, they are known to take pleasure in fighting, circumventing and subverting rigid rule systems, but also to be ready to take on completely arbitrary challenges without questioning their validity.},

abstract = {Competitive maneuvering in the information economy has raised a pressing question: how can firms raise profits by giving away products for free? This paper provides a possible answer and articulates a strategy space for information product design. Free strategic complemenets can raise a firm's own profits while free strategic substitutes can lower profits for competitors. We introduce a formal model of a cross-market externalities based in textbook economics - a mix of Katz {\&} Shapiro network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation - that leads to novel strategies such as an eagerness to enter into Bertrand price competition. This combination helps to explain many recent firm strategies such as those of Microsoft Netscape (AOL), Sun, Adobe, and ID. The model presented here argues for three simple and intuitive results. First, a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity even in the absence of competition. Second, we identify distinct markets for content-providers and end-consumers and show that either can be a candidate for the free good. Third, a firm can use strategic product design to penetrate a market that becomes competitive post-entry. The model therefore helps to explain several interesting market behaviors such as free goods, upgrade paths, split versioning, and strategic information substitutes.},

Analysis of the survey results provided some interesting insights into factors differentiating "more agile" organizations from "less agile" organizations. "More agile" companies from this study can be characterized as more customer focused, and applying a combination of "soft" and "hard" methodologies in order to meet changing customer requirements. They also see the involvement of suppliers in this process as being crucial to their ability to attain high levels of customer satisfaction. The "less agile" group, on the other hand, can be characterized as more internally focused with a bias toward internal operational outcomes. They saw no link between any of the independent variables and innovation, and appear to see technology as more closely linked to the promotion of these operational outcomes than to customer satisfaction. The role of suppliers for this group is to support productivity and process improvement rather than to promote customer satisfaction.},

We also examine the effects of market structure changes on intellectual property rights issues. Finally, we present a series of minicases that provide evidence in support of the proposed theoretical perspective.},

abstract = {As profit margins gradually decline, and market competition becomes increasingly intensive, 3G telecom operators must provide various mobile value-added services, as well as traditional voice services, to attract new subscribers and retain old ones. However, for many 3G mobile value-added services, whether ARPU (average revenue per user) can be effectively enhanced depends on the consumer behavioral intentions. Therefore, this study uses the Technology Acceptance Model as the foundation and incorporate personal innovativeness and perceived cost to further understand consumer's behavioral intention to use 3G mobile value-added services. The following conclusions can be reached from the research findings: (1) consumer usage rate of current 3G value-added services remains low; (2) increased personal innovativeness will directly enhance the perceived ease of use of 3G mobile value-added services; (3) the perceived usefulness is enhanced when consumers perceive higher ease of use of value-added services; (4) perceived usefulness has the strongest effect on consumer attitude, followed by perceived ease of use and perceived cost, and (5) the most important factor in increasing consumer's behavioral intention to use 3G mobile value-added services is attitude, followed by perceived ease of use, perceived cost and perceived usefulness. Results of this study provide a valuable reference for service providers to develop mobile value-added services. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Regulating children's and adolescents' access to video games appeared on the agenda of media lawmakers from the 1990s on. Approaches in western democracies have largely followed the approach of industry self-regulation, resulting in a diverse set of different types of self-regulation systems. This study applies a comparative perspective on the actual rating practices, asking how far regulation systems differ systematically and how far these differences might lead to different rating decisions. The study analyzes both the set-up of three major western regulation systems (the German USK, the pan-European PEGI and the US ESRB) and the actual rating decisions in each of the three systems relying on secondary data at the aggregate level, individual rating decisions for 182 top-selling titles and a list of favorite video games of 744 adolescents in the US and Germany. Findings illustrate that each system has a distinct focus, according to which it regulates different video game use more strongly than the other systems. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. The authors focus on multihoming-the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.},

These informal terms require scientific explanation, which amounts to providing measurable criteria for different experiential states. This paper reports the results of an experimental psychophysiological study investigating different traits of gameplay experience using subjective and objective measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game modifications while being measured with electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, galvanic skin response and eye tracking equipment. In addition, questionnaire responses were collected after each play session. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated measurable high-arousal positive affect emotions. The positive correlation between subjective and objective indicators of gameplay experience shows the great potential of the method presented here for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be correlated with self-reported subjective descriptions.},

Interactivity in the form of natural mapping has been advocated as a possible contributor to presence experiences, yet few studies to date have investigated this potential. The present work formulates a preliminary typology of natural mapping and addresses how several types of mapping impact the experience of a video game, with the expectation that more natural mapping leads to increased spatial presence affecting enjoyment. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, 48 participants played a golfing video game using one of two controller types (Nintendo Wiimote or gamepad). In the second, 78 participants played a driving video game using an even more natural controller (steering wheel) or one of three other controller types. Participants then completed measures of perceived naturalness, presence, and enjoyment. Results of both studies were generally consistent with expectations.},

Because VR interfaces are difficult and expensive to build, the computer graphics community needs to be able to predict which applications will benefit from VR. In this paper, we show that users with a VR interface complete a search task faster than users with a stationary monitor and a hand-based input device. We placed users in the center of the virtual room shown in Figure 1 and told them to look for camouflaged targets. VR users did not do significantly better than desktop users. However, when asked to search the room and conclude if a target existed, VR users were substantially better at determining when they had searched the entire room. Desktop users took 41{\%} more time, re-examining areas they had already searched. We also found a positive transfer of training from VR to stationary displays and a negative transfer of training from stationary displays to VR.},

abstract = {Over the last three decades, the prevailing view of information technology strategy has been that it is a functional-level strategy that must be aligned with the firm's chosen business strategy. Even within this so- called alignment view, business strategy directed IT strategy. During the last decade, the business infrastructure has become digital with increased interconnections among products, processes, and services. Across many firms spanning different industries and sectors, digital technologies (viewed as combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies) are fundamentally transforming business strategies, business processes, firm capabilities, products and services, and key interfirm relationships in extended business networks. Accordingly, we argue that the time is right to rethink the role of IT strategy, from that of a functional-level strategy—aligned but essentially always subordinate to business strategy—to one that reflects a fusion between IT strategy and business strategy. This fusion is herein termed digital business strategy. We identify four key themes to guide our thinking on digital business strategy and help provide a framework to define the next generation of insights. The four themes are (1) the scope of digital business strategy, (2) the scale of digital business strategy, (3) the speed of digital business strategy, and (4) the sources of business value creation and capture in digital business strategy. After elaborating on each of these four themes, we discuss the success metrics and potential performance implications from pursuing a digital business strategy. We also show how the papers in the special issue shed light on digital strategies and offer directions to advance insights and shape future research.},

Based on our study of historical standards wars, we have identified several generic strategies, along with a number of winning tactics, to help companies fighting today's—and tomorrow's—battles. There is no doubt about the significance of standards battles in today's economy. Public attention is currently focused on the Browser War between Microsoft and Netscape (oops, America On-Line). Even as Judge Jackson evalu- ates the legality of Microsoft's tactics in the Browser War, the Audio and Video Streaming Battle is heating up between Microsoft and RealNetworks over soft- ware to deliver audio and video over the Internet. The 56k Modem War of 1997 pitted 3Com against Rockwell and Lucent. Microsoft's Word and Excel have vanquished WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 respectively. Most everyone remem- bers the Video-Cassette Recorder Duel of the 1980s, in which Matsushita's VHS format triumphed over Sony's Betamax format. However, few recall how Philips's digital compact cassette and Sony's minidisk format both flopped in the early 1990s. This year, it's DVD versus Divx in the battle to replace both VCRs},

abstract = {The introduction and popularity of the Nintendo Wii home console has brought attention to the natural mapping motion capturing controller. Using a sample that identified sports as their most frequently played video games, a mental models approach was used to test the impact that perceived controller naturalness (traditional controller vs. natural mapping motion capturing controller) had on perceptions of spatial presence, realism, and enjoyment. The results showed that perceived video game realism is a predictor of spatial presence and enjoyment. Furthermore, the results supported predictions that controller naturalness would influence perceived video game realism of graphics and sound. Future research should investigate whether or not these controllers lead to greater presence and enjoyment in different genres of games (e.g., first-person shooters). In addition, future research should consider whether or not these controllers have the ability to prime violent mental models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Sophisticated analysis of all the positioning alternatives can, and should, be done. How should a new brand be positioned? Can a problem brand be revived by a repositioning strategy? Most marketing managers have addressed these and other positioning questions; however, "positioning" means different things to different people. To some, it means the segmentation decision. To others it is an image question. To still others it means selecting which product features to emphasize. Few managers consider ail of these alternatives. Further, the positioning decision is often made ad hoc, and is based upon flashes of insight, even though systematic, research-based approaches to the positioning decision are now available. An understanding of these approaches should lead to more sophisticated analysis in which positioning alternatives are more fully identified and evaluated. A product or organization has many associations which combine to form a total impression. The positioning decision often means selecting those associations which are to be built upon and emphasized and those associations which are to be removed or de-emphasized. The term "position" differs from the older term "image" in that it implies a frame of reference, the reference point usually being the competition. Thus, when the Bank of California positions itself as being small and friendly, it is explictly, or perhaps implicitly, positioning itself with respect to Bank of America. The positioning decision is often the crucial strategic decision for a company or brand because the position can be central to customers' perception and choice, decisions. Further, since all elements of the marketing program can potentially affect the position, it is usually necessary to use a positioning strategy as a focus for the development of the marketing program. A clear positioning strategy can insure that the elements of the marketing program are consistent and supportive. What alternative positioning strategies are a...

abstract = {Digital games have become a remarkable cultural phenomenon in the last ten years. The casual games sector especially has been growing rapidly in the last few years. However, there is no clear view on what is "casual" in games cultures and the area has not previously been rigorously studied. In the discussions on casual games, "casual" is often taken to refer to the player, the game or the playing style, but other factors such as business models and accessibility are also considered as characteristic of "casual" in games. Views on casual vary and confusion over different meanings can lead to paradoxical readings, which is especially the case when "casual gamer" is taken to mean both "someone who plays casual games" and someone who "plays casually". In this article we will analyse the ongoing discussion by providing clarification of the different meanings of casual and a framework for an overall understanding of casual in the level of expanded game experience.},

abstract = {The author presents a conceptual model of brand equity from the perspective of the individual consumer. Customer-based brand equity is defined as the differential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing of the brand. A brand is said to have positive (negative) customer-based brand equity when consumers react more (less) favorably to an element of the marketing mix for the brand than they do to the same marketing mix element when it is attributed to a fictitiously named or unnamed version of the product or service. Brand knowledge is conceptualized according to an associative network memory model in terms of two components, brand awareness and brand image (i.e., a set of brand associations). Customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer is familiar with the brand and holds some favorable, strong, and unique brand associations in memory. Issues in building, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity are discussed, as well as areas for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientiﬁc understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and inﬂuences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci {\&} Ryan, 2000; Ryan {\&} Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {t Concerns about the content of videogames continue to hold media attention, but researchers like Gee (2003) and Thomas and Brown (2007, 2011) have dug deeper in order to explore how the merging of play and learning within game structures encourages learning and a “gamer disposition” (Brown and Thomas, 2008). Building on research into communities in computer-mediated spaces (Boellstorff, 2008; Nardi, 2010; Rheingold, 2000; Taylor, 2006; Turkle, 1995), this paper argues that the majority of World of Warcraft players are not stereotypical “first-generation” gamers but are instead “second-generation” gamers who are new to online game spaces and do not have a firm grasp of gaming culture or a gamer disposition. By examining their gameplay styles, social interaction, and entry into gaming culture, the dispositions of second-generation gamers contrast with “the gamer disposition;” however, as these players become more invested in gaming culture, they can develop a first-generation disposition.},

We present a study of the differentiated nature of participation in gaming based on field observations of six families playing physical videogames in their homes. Building on existing theoretical frameworks, we distinguish three kinds of durable roles: players, audience members and bystanders. Going beyond this, we also identify a rich variety of spontaneous and ephemeral roles among the audience: spectators, orchestrators, managers, coaches, directors, puppeteers, commentators, hecklers, supporters, documenters, shadow players, and cheerleaders. We argue that through this richer understanding of the differentiated nature of participation in videogaming, designers might expand the reach of their games and respond to the potential for new experiences in the broad situation of domestic gaming.},

abstract = {Given the social nature of digital gaming, an investigation into social processes underpinning the experiences within social contexts of play is greatly warranted. The current research explored the underpinnings of "group flow" within cooperative-based gaming. In particular, this was intended to provide insight into the social processes which facilitate flow experiences in these contexts. This was achieved through a questionnaire in which gamers (N = 76) provided retrospective open-ended accounts of flow during cooperative gaming. Additionally, quantitative data was obtained on flow and post-gameplay mood within this experience, as well as in solo gaming for comparative analysis. Thematic analysis of the qualitative responses revealed a number of factors which determined the experience of flow. These were; effective communication and team-work and task relevant knowledge of group members. Additionally, although flow was found to be lower in cooperative versus solo gaming, no differences in post-gameplay mood were observed. These findings aid conceptual development of facilitators of group flow in cooperative gaming, with insights into how this may extend to other cooperative activities. Additionally, they also provide new practical insight for representatives in the gaming industry on how gaming may be developed with the aim of promoting positive shared group experiences.},

@inproceedings{Jenson2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we briefly outline some of the early research in the field of digital games and education that attempted to answer the question of what and how people learn from playing games. We then turn to the recent revolution in gameplay controllers (from the classic controller to the Wii wand, plastic guitars, microphones and even plastic drums) to argue that gameplay has only just undergone a significant epistemological shift, one that no longer sees gameplay as the simulation of actions on a screen, but instead enables imitation as the central element of gameplay, perhaps effectively for the first time giving players access to a form of play-based learning relegated to the very young. This radical modification of the way games are played, from simulation to imitation, has already attracted new audiences: in Japan, female players exceed male players on the handheld Nintendo DS, in the U.S. and in Canada and elsewhere seniors' homes are purchasing the Nintendo Wii (with its suite of sports games) to encourage residents to exercise, and one of the hottest selling games of December 2007 was Rock Band, a game in which players form a band and play using a "guitar", drums and a microphone as controllers. Playing games is not a "solo" act: the player is both acting and acted upon by the technology, and his/her play is very much situated within a broader network of actions, actors and activities which are community-based and! supported. The question of what and how players are learning in games has been at the forefront of research on education and game-play in the last several years when we began to ask what and how people learned from playing commercial entertainment-oriented digital games. Long viewed as artifacts of an "unpopular culture," particularly by educators and educational theorists, commercial videogames are now recognized as highly effective learning environments where player (as learner) agency is paramount, and where the acquisition of knowledge and competency is infused in engaging and pleasurable play, not a prescribed task (de Castell and Jenson, 2003, 2005; Gee 2003, 2005; Prensky, 2006; Squire, 2002). As such, the primary argument for the paper will be to examine new controllers not as simulative experiences, but as technologies that support players' embodied competence, rather than players' ability to simulate such competence.},

abstract = {The enormous popularity of the Nintendo Wii, Guitar Hero, and smaller games like Bejeweled or Zuma has turned the stereotype of the obsessed young male gamer on its head. Players of these casual games are not required to possess an intimate knowledge of video game history or to devote weeks or months to play. At the same time, many players of casual games show a dedication and skill that is anything but casual. In A Casual Revolution, Jesper Juul describes this as a reinvention of video games, and of our image of video game players, and explores what this tells us about the players, the games, and their interaction.With this reinvention of video games, the game industry reconnects with a general audience. Many of today's casual game players once enjoyed Pac-Man, Tetris, and other early games, only to drop out when video games became more time consuming and complex. For a long time, video games asked players to structure their lives to fit the demands of a game; with casual games, it is the game that is designed to fit into the lives of players. These flexible games make it possible for everyone to be a video game player.Juul shows that it is only by understanding what a game requires of players, what players bring to a game, how the game industry works, and how video games have developed historically that we can understand what makes video games fun and why we choose to play (or not to play) them.},

abstract = {The recent diffusion of advanced controllers, initially designed for the home game console, has been rapidly followed by the release of proprietary or third part PC drivers and SDKs suitable for implementing new forms of 3D user interfaces based on gestures. Exploiting the devices currently available on the game market, it is now possible to enrich, with low cost motion capture, the user interaction with desktop computers by building new forms of natural interfaces and new action metaphors that add the third dimension as well as a physical extension to interaction with users. This paper presents two systems specifically designed for 3D gestural user interaction on 3D geographical maps. The proposed applications rely on two consumer technologies both capable of motion tracking: the Nintendo Wii and the Microsoft Kinect devices. The work also evaluates, in terms of subjective usability and perceived sense of Presence and Immersion, the effects on users of the two different controllers and of the 3D navigation metaphors adopted. Results are really encouraging and reveal that, users feel deeply immerse in the 3D dynamic experience, the gestural interfaces quickly bring the interaction from novice to expert style and enrich the synthetic nature of the explored environment exploiting user physicality.},

abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97{\%} playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of “gaming” has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

abstract = {Presently, video game designers, players, and often even video game theorists approach the representation of point-of-view in video games as intuitive and uncomplicated. Drawing on the current critical work on video games, theories of immersion and engagement, and theories of human-computer-interaction, I question the significance of optical perspective in video games in terms of player point-of-view. Because video games are an experiential medium, critical study of video games must include the study of the diegetic, visual-auditory, interface, and experiential (often termed interactive or participatory) aspects of video game play. Through an analysis of the various points-of-view within different games and the differing points-of-view within a single game, I attempt to delineate the differences both in the creation of the experiential game space and in the possibilities for immersion within the game space. For this, I delimit two types of immersion: diegetic immersion, which corresponds to immersion in the game, and intra-diegetic or situated immersion, which corresponds to immersion within the created virtual space of the game situated through both a character's perspective and an embodied point-of-view. I discuss how these are not necessarily mutually exclusive and how they can and do blend together, combined with the game's overall representation of perspective, for varied gaming experiences. I conclude with an analysis of how differing perspectives and points-of-view influence gameplay and game world spatial understanding.},

abstract = {A main reason to play computer games is the pleasure of being immersed in a mediated world. Spatial presence and flow are considered key concepts to explain such immersive experiences.However, little attention has been paid to the connection between the two concepts. Thus, we empirically examined the relationship between presence and flow in the context of a computer role- playing game (N = 70), a racing game (N = 120), and a jump and run game (N = 72). In all three studies, factor analysis revealed that presence and flow are distinct constructs, which do hardly share common variance.We conclude that presence refers to the sensation of being there in the mediated world, whereas flow rather refers to the sensation of being involved in the gaming action. Further analyses showed that flow and presence depend on motivation and immersive tendency. In addition, flow and presence enhanced performance as well as enjoyment.},

abstract = {Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers alike, it is still not clear what immersion means. This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants' abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

abstract = {A plethora of definitions for innovation types has resulted in an ambiguity in the way the terms 'innovation' and 'innovativeness' are operationalized and utilized in the new product development literature. The terms radical, really-new, incremental and discontinuous are used ubiquitously to identify innovations. One must question, what is the difference between these different classifications? To date consistent definitions for these innovation types have not emerged from the new product research community. A review of the literature from the marketing, engineering, and new product development disciplines attempts to put some clarity and continuity to the use of these terms. This review shows that it is important to consider both a marketing and technological perspective as well as a macrolevel and microlevel perspective when identifying innovations. Additionally, it is shown when strict classifications from the extant literature are applied, a significant shortfall appears in empirical work directed toward radical and really new innovations. A method for classifying innovations is suggested so that practitioners and academics can talk with a common understanding of how a specific innovation type is identified and how the innovation process may be unique for that particular innovation type. A recommended list of measures based on extant literature is provided for future empirical research concerning technological innovations and innovativeness. {\textcopyright} 2002 PDMA.

Conventional knowledge holds that the roles of various product success drivers do not differ significantly across these sequential channels of distribution. The authors examine sequential distribution channels within the motion picture industry and develop a model that proposes that such differences exist between a primary (short- and long-term theatrical box office) and a sequential (video rental) channel. The authors test their model with a sample of 331 motion pictures released in theaters and on video during 1999-2001 using partial least squares. Results reveal differences in the impact of success factors across channels. For example, cultural familiarity enhances box office success but relates negatively to video rental success, and distribution intensity and date of release enhance box office outcomes but have no impact on rental revenues.},

With the recent changes in the field, we also witness an expansion in genres and user groups. A seemingly basic question gains new relevance in light of the growing diversification: Why do people turn to various types of computer games? In this study, we examine the relationship between gaming gratifications and genre preferences on the basis of a multivariate model deduced from previous research. We applied this model to survey data from a representative sample of 4500 gamers. We found that, apart from socio-demographics, individual and content-related gratifications are relevant predictors for genre preferences, especially for "core-gamer" genres such as roleplaying or action and shooter games. Beyond the "core-gamer", there is large group of (older) casual players who prefer puzzle and simulation games and seek fewer and different gratifications from computer gaming.},

@article{Hennig-Thurau2001,
abstract = {The identification of factors that determine the success of innovations is a well-established field of research in marketing, yet the literature on service innovations remains scarce. In this article, by drawing on new institutional economics theory and its sub-discipline, economics of information theory, we use the specific characteristics of services as a starting point for the development of a general framework of service innovations' success. The general framework is then applied to motion pictures which, despite their economic relevance, represent a clearly under-researched area of services. Most important for our choice, motion pictures are characterized by a high degree of innovativeness.                  The general framework of service innovations' success presented builds upon the absence of search qualities of new services. Based on this general lack of characteristics that the customer can easily evaluate before consuming the service, there is a strong need for the service provider to transform experience qualities into what can be called "quasi-search qualities." Quasi-search and experience qualities are the subject of service-related communication. With regard to the latter, we distinguish between company-related and non-company related information sources as key determinants of the success of an innovative service offer. Consumers can learn about a service's quasi-search qualities either via the service provider's communicative activities (i.e., advertising) or via neutral information sources, i.e., word-of-mouth communication by other consumers or information from buyer-helping businesses (e.g., restaurant and book critics, travel agents).                  Although consumers and buyer-helping businesses may also make quasi-search qualities the subject of discussion, their focus is clearly on experience qualities. This is due to high credibility and trust which consumers tend to associate with these kinds of information. In contrast, the focus of service providers' communication is on quasi-search qualities. Both types of communication (i.e., service-provider communication and neutral communication) are not independent because (a) word-of-mouth and critics' comments are not limited to the service provider's performance but can also include its advertising measures, and (b) evaluations of the new service by 'neutral' institutions (e.g., customers, product-testing agencies) can be implemented in the service provider's communication strategy. Although other marketing variables also influence the customer's evaluation of a service (distribution, pricing, timing of market entry), communication can be seen as crucial for the diffusion of a new service. In addition, the framework covers the first-time customer's decision to visit the service provider repeatedly and the crucial role of the consumer's degree of satisfaction with the service provider, with the expectation component of the latter being strongly influenced by the service provider's and neutral information the customer receives before consuming the service for the first time.                  The Case of Motion Pictures: An Application and Concretization of the General Framework  The general framework of service innovations' success is applied to a single service sector, namely to motion pictures. Based on the general framework, insights into the determinants of a motion picture's success and their inter-relationships are derived. Basically, two basic groups of determinants of the economic success of a motion picture are distinguished; movie traits and motion picture-related communication. Movie traits, as a concretization of the general category of service traits, cover (a) factors that moviegoers can comprehend before watching a movie (i.e., quasi-search qualities) and (b) those they can only comprehend after watching it (i.e., experience qualities). Quasi-search movie traits include; movie genre, symbolicity, success in previous exploitation levels, and several structure qualities (i.e., attractiveness of personnel, budget, language, country of origin, movie length), while a motion picture's experience traits overlap with the concept of aesthetic quality. Motion-picture related communication include; movie advertising as the main company-controlled information source and movie reviews, awards, and word-of-mouth as important neutral information sources. With regard to motion-picture success as the outcome variable of the framework, great importance is attached in the movie industry to the number of moviegoers and the respective box-office gross (i.e., income figures), as well as to a motion picture's profitability. These two objectives are closely linked, but can also result in strategic conflicts when it comes to resource allocation issues. The interrelations between traits, communication, and success are discussed in detail in the article.                  Implications and Conclusion  The implications of this article are two-fold. Firstly, the general framework developed in this article extends the existing knowledge on the success of service innovations. Driven by economics of information theory considerations, we suggest that a focus on service features and their evaluation by consumers offers new insights into the literature on the management of new services. Accordingly, attention must be paid to the transformation of experience qualities into what is called quasi-search qualities; service features that consumers are able to evaluate in advance and that allow them to infer key experience qualities of the new service.                  Secondly, as the application of the general framework shows, several aspects important for the success of new motion pictures are pointed out. With movie traits and movie-related communication, two basic types of success factors are identified and their impact on a motion picture's success is explored. By combining the various variables of the framework which represent elaborations of the general categories, movie producers might be able to reduce uncertainty surrounding a movie's likely economic success. Essentially, the framework demonstrates that stars and other movie attributes are used by consumers as quasi-search qualities enabling them to evaluate the motion picture prior to watching it.                  The importance of the different elements of the model must be differentiated with regard to a short-term and a long-term perspective of motion-picture success. As the number of screens on which a movie opens nation-wide is continually raised by movie distributors, a higher share of the success of a motion picture is earned in a relatively short period of time, especially in the opening weekend. This assigns an important role to quasi-search characteristics (e.g., symbolicity and especially the movie's "brand") while experience qualities (e.g., interplay of the movie's components) become less important. However, for a movie to become a long-term box-office success, quasi-search elements have to be complemented by an adequate overall or outcome quality which is communicated through viewers' word-of-mouth. Further implications are derived that may help to improve the effectiveness of motion-picture marketing.},

abstract = {Several cross-section and training studies have shown that video game play can improve cognitive functions such as visual attention, cognitive control, visual short-term memory, and general processing speed. Unfortunately the replication of these effects is not always successful, even when using similar cognitive tests to measure performance. We investigated an important aspect of this field that has not yet been empirically addressed: the role of video game genre. Our comparison of two video game player groups of specific genres (first-person shooter and real-time strategy) indicates that cognitive abilities (measured by task switching and multiple object tracking) may be differentially enhanced depending on the genre of video game being played. This result is significant as research to this point has focused on "action video games", a loosely defined category that encompasses several video game genres, without controlling for effects potentially stemming from differences in mechanics between these video games. It also provides some evidence for the specificity of video game play benefits as a function of actions performed within the game, which is not in line with a generalized "learning to learn" accounting of these enhancements.},

Today, as online gaming has become a major leisure time activity, it seems worthwhile asking for the underlying factors of online social capital acquisition and whether online social capital increases offline social support. In the present study, we proposed that the online game players' physical and social proximity as well as their mutual familiarity influence bridging and bonding social capital. Physical proximity was predicted to positively influence bonding social capital online. Social proximity and familiarity were hypothesized to foster both online bridging and bonding social capital. Additionally, we hypothesized that both social capital dimensions are positively related to offline social support. The hypotheses were tested with regard to members of e-sports clans. In an online survey, participants (N = 811) were recruited via the online portal of the Electronic Sports League (ESL) in several countries. The data confirmed all hypotheses, with the path model exhibiting an excellent fit. The results complement existing research by showing that online gaming may result in strong social ties, if gamers engage in online activities that continue beyond the game and extend these with offline activities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Social online games are a mass phenomenon and, for most of the users, a social activity. Even though there are numerous studies on social online games they do not explicitly investigate the offline contacts of the gamers, which play a significant role for their social embeddedness. Regarding the online gaming-related contacts possible strong ties such as friendship relationships are often neglected. Additionally modality switching between the two spheres is not further investigated. In this paper, we strive to extend the research on the interrelation of social game use and the social embeddedness of social online gamers, as well as modality switching between the online and offline context. In doing so we provide new insights into the emergence and quality of gaming-related relationships. We collected information on everyday life as well as on gaming-related friendships from a representative sample of 2213 gamers and 287 non-gamers in Germany. Our results show that social online gamers do not differ significantly from other gamers or non-gamers regarding the number of their good friends. However, we found a significant impact of social online gaming frequency on the probability of meeting exclusively online friends. Different social motives played an important role for modality switching processes. Players with a pronounced motive to gain social capital and to play in a team had the highest probability to transform their social relations from online to offline context. We found that social online gamers are well integrated and use the game to spend time with old friends - and to recruit new ones. Our results suggest that gaming-related ties might be very useful: especially modality switching between the two spheres might lead to strong ties and accordingly to additional bonding social capital. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Video games are, for instance, distributed in digital data form, which can only be used on compatible hardware. Network effects drive the diffusion of such systems. This article provides insights into market heterogeneity and the role that expectations of the direct and indirect network effects plays in the game console market. The results of two empirical studies suggest that the console market is strongly fragmented and that the perceptions of network effects differ between the various target segments. The same holds for the importance of consumer expectations: For instance, hardcore gamers make predictions about the future software availability and incorporate these into their current adoption decision, while social gamers care more about the expected potential to interact with others. When introducing novel technologies, platform sponsors can benefit from improved targeting by, for example, providing software selectively, instead of large varieties early on. This study identifies the limits of go-to-market strategies derived from aggregate analyses when dealing with network effects and shows that behavioristic insights should complement them.},

abstract = {Research in indirect network effects has simplistically treated complementary product variety as the total number of complementary products (e.g., game titles in video game markets). This assumption of equi-differentiation ignores differences across genres or product categories. Furthermore, since consumers with differential preferences for variety enter the market at different stages, consumer heterogeneity in preference for variety in complementary products may evolve as the market develops. We propose a model that recognizes these previously ignored, but important, demand characteristics, and empirically investigate the effects of breadth and depth of software variety on consumer hardware adoption in the fifth-generation video game market. We find that early adopters seek variety across a wide spectrum of game genres, and that late adopters are interested only in action-oriented games and have no interest in strategy-oriented games unless they are so-called "superstars." Our findings imply that effective variety planning should be built along both dimensions, instead of simply assuming that more is better. Our policy simulations demonstrate that variety planning is as critical as entry timing to the success of platform companies in system competition, and is one of the reasons for PlayStation's winning the battle against Nintendo64. In addition, the boosting effect of a new title on hardware sales perishes quickly, so it is important to have a cascade strategy to guarantee a continuous supply of complementary software.},

abstract = {Systems are composed of complementary products (e.g., video game systems are composed of the video game console and video games). Prior literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as "hardware") largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often referred to as "software"). Mathematical and empirical analyses have almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence, case illustrations show that certain high-quality, "superstar" software titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales by an average of 14{\%} (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the hardware required to use the software. Software type does not consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase hardware sales. Hardware firms' exclusivity over superstars does not provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.},

The industry exhibits six generations of technological changes in video game consoles and complementary products, with each generation represented by a new set of competitors, dominant designs, and market leaders out-competing the leaders of the prior generation. Their analysis confirms the efficacy of traditional tenets of successful strategic management in a network-based industry, such as the importance of technological innovation, building entry barriers, protecting firm-specific assets, competitive pricing, brand recognition and effective channel management.

We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting non-cooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega). Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for this situation in which the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) was able to overtake the sales of a firm with a larger network size (Sega). These empirical results suggest that the ultimate outcome in a competitive market with network effects is more complex than simply accepting that the firm with the largest installed customer base will always be the winner},

abstract = {Abstract Nintendo lost its dominant position in the video game industry during the console war between its Nintendo 64 and Sony's PlayStation. However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Ni...},

abstract = {As consumers play video game consoles, they become more engaged with the product and formulate a relationship with it. From this, perceived brand personality traits may manifest among consumers. This study investigates how consumers perceive video game console brand personalities. Although previous studies have looked at media brand personalities in television channels and newspapers, none have applied Aaker's Brand Personality Scale Dimensions (1997) towards video game consoles. The seventh generation of video game consoles was selected, since it has recently ended with the advent of the eighth generation of video game consoles. The video game consoles examined include Nintendo's Wii, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. A convenience sample of undergraduate students at a large southeastern university was selected, and principal component factor analyses were conducted for each video game brand personality, as well as a composite factor analysis to look at overall consumer perceptions of video game brand personalities across all three seventh generation video game consoles. Today, roughly 56{\%} of all households in the United States own at least one seventh generation video game console (Nielsen, 2012). During the last decade, amid innovations in graphics, methods of engagement, and alternative entertainment options, the competition among the three mainstream video game console companies (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) has become even fiercer. With every new generation of video game consoles, defined as non-portable video game play devices that rely on a television screen, these companies have introduced unique graphics, methods of playing video games as well as user abilities to access other modes of entertainment such as film, television, or the Internet. When consumers interact with video game consoles, they realize certain attributes or characteristics of a video game console by either playing video games or interacting with other features on a video game console. These experiences can influence consumers' video game console brand personality perceptions, or the particular personal adjectives that consumers ascribe toward video game consoles. This study examines consumers' video game console brand personality perceptions. Previous studies have not directly explored consumers' video game console brand personality perceptions. Lin (2010) found that outgoing video game consumers were likely to be drawn to excitement, competence and sincerity brand personalities in video games and toys. However, this study used BANDAI brand hand-held video games, which are portable and significantly different from video game consoles. Moreover, the concept of media brand personalities has been explored in television channel brands (Chan-Olmsted {\&} Cha, 2007) and newspaper brands (Kim, Baek, {\&} Martin, 2010). Differently, video game consoles are an interactive media that engender different relationships with consumers. As the top three mainstream video game console companies, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony have all introduced new eighth generation video game consoles into the marketplace (Wii U, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, respectively)(Totilo, 2013), this presents a unique opportunity to specifically analyze the brand personalities of the previous (seventh) generation's three top selling video game consoles: Nintendo's Wii, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3 (Benedetti, 2012; Chen {\&} Streitfeld, 2013; Smith, 2012). The Wii was introduced in 2006, the Xbox 360 was introduced in 2005 and the PlayStation 3 was introduced in 2006 (" ABC News, " 2005; Morris, 2006; Schiesel, 2006a). Therefore, consumers have had an opportunity to become acquainted with seventh generation video game consoles from their introduction and peak in the video game marketplace, beginning in 2005 to until 2012, when the Wii U was introduced and ushered in the eighth generation of video game consoles (Wingfield, 2012). As a result, consumers should be highly familiar with the seventh generation video game consoles and be able to divulge their own perceptions of the seventh generation video game consoles' brand personalities. The aim of this study is to create brand personality scales that are representative of each video game console in the seventh generation. In order to extract consumers' perceived video game console brand personality adjectives, a principal component factor analysis was performed for each video game console. This study furthers the current academic literature stream regarding video game marketing and use of brand personalities. For the industry, it will help inform practitioners of consumers' perceptions of seventh generation video game consoles brand personalities. The creation of brand personality scales may serve as a metric of brand health for a parent video game 64},

abstract = {In contrast with traditional forms of entertainment media (e.g., movies, novels, and television), video games are unique in their ability to provide immersion, agency, and transformation (IAT) during the consumptive experience. As the video game medium has evolved over generations of consoles, the experience of IAT has become increasingly complex from the perspective of consumers. To better understand this phenomenon, this research presents a framework for understanding the consumption of video games by examining the intersection of player, narrative, and gameplay. Our findings suggest that advancements in video game technology and design have gradually increased the degree of integration among these domains. Although the subjective experience of IAT has generally improved as a function of greater in-tegration, various conflicts arise from the tensions that exist between player, narrative, and gameplay. Consequently, this research explores the specific nature of such conflicts to provide a richer understanding of video game consumption and the impact of its evolution on con-sumers.},

Tying occurs when a console hardware manufacturer produces software that is incompatible with rival hardware. There are two important trade-offs an integrated firm faces when implementing a technological tie. The first is an effect that increases console market power and forces hardware prices higher. The second, an effect due to the integration of the firm, drives prices lower. A counterfactual exercise determines technological tying of hardware and software increases console price competition; console makers subsidize consumer hardware purchases in order to increase video games sales, in particular their tied games, where the greatest proportion of industry profits are made. I also determine technological tying to be a dominant strategy for hardware manufacturers when software development costs are low.},

abstract = {We discuss the differences between incremental and radical innovation and argue that each results from different processes. We present several methods of viewing incremental and radical innovation. One is by examining the quality of product space, envisioning each product opportunity as a hill in that space where the higher one is, the better. Under this view, human-centered design methods are a form of hill climbing, extremely well suited for continuous incremental improvements but incapable of radical innovation. Radical innovation requires finding a different hill, and this comes about only through meaning or technology change. A second approach is to consider the dimensions of meaning and technology change as two dimensions and examining how products move through the resulting space. Finally, we show how innovation might be viewed as lying in the space formed by the dimension of research aimed at enhancing general knowledge and the dimension of application to practice.$\backslash$nWe conclude that human-centered design, with its emphasis on iterated observation, ideation, and testing is ideally suited for incremental innovation and unlikely to lead to radical innovation. Radical innovation comes from changes in either technology or meaning. Technology-driven innovation often comes from inventors and tinkerers. Meaning-driven innovation, however, has the potential to be driven through design research, but only if the research addresses fundamental questions of new meanings and their interpretation.},

Especially in system markets, content providers must decide whether to publish new content in late lifecycle stages or wait for the next system generation. This study investigates whether content providers can compensate for declines in demand for a system by relying on the benefits offered by a large installed base in later lifecycle stages. Drawing on extensive market data from the video game industry - an underresearched but economically and culturally relevant category of the entertainment sector - this study examines ways to achieve such compensation. The data analyses show a negative association between the age of a system generation and content sales. However, an online multiplayer feature can counteract this negative effect by exploiting the large installed base and providing consumers with additional social value through direct network effects. These findings should help managers position their products more successfully in the late lifecycle stages of a particular system generation.},
